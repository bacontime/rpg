# Aerbian Landmasses

I made a map for the world of Worth the Candle, by Alexander Wales. 
Below are some details about the fantasy continents in this world.

While the map  is canon, many of the details below are just things I was thinking while making the map.
So I wouldn't even call this document "semi-canon". Any details which aren't present in the actual story should be considered worldbuilding fanfic.

## Impossible Geography

Aerb has a lot of examples of 'What if X' in its design. 
Strange locations that represent a concept stretched to its limits.

FIAF
: The continent of FIAF was created as a self-similar fractal. Mountains at one end were duplicated as hills then mounds, then motes of dust. This isn't a space-warping effect, and the fractal nature of the content isn't magically sustained, so the smallest iterations of the continent's features have been eroded into unrecognizability.

Leto
: A ring of mountains surrounds a arid, flat, isolated plateau roughly the size of Iowa. Exotic xerophile fauna live in this 'dry island' (microantelopes and sandwyrms are abundant). 

Apes
: Like its sister continent Leto, Apes has a ring of mountains which isolate the interior. But whereas Leto's interior is cool and arid, Apes' interior is hot and humid. (It's also much much larger.) Water in the Apes basin quickly evaporates, but is trapped by the high mountains, giving this region a nearly self-contained water cycle. In the summertime, the interior region of Apes is inhospitable to human life.

Greg
: Greg is an island which is *perfectly* hexagonal. If its beaches are disturbed, the grains of sand will, very slowly, move to make the island hexagonal again.

Crososo
: The crescent-shaped continent of Crososo surrounds the super shallow Croso Sea. At low tide, this sea may only be ankle deep in places. It's one of the most biodiverse locations on the hex thanks to the many coral reefs and beds of sea-grass therein.

The Ridges
: Between the Catric and Specific Oceans lay a series of long, thin, steep mountain chains, which jut out of the sea like winding snakes. The largest of these ridges are the Hesh'al Chain, the continent of Calijo, and the Tail of Sonder, each of which is many thousands of miles in length. The most dramatic of the ridges is smaller (though still over 1000 miles in length), and is simply called "The Ridge". The Ridge looks like a sheer wall rising nearly a mile high out of the ocean. Its two sides are seperated by only a few miles, but are populated by entirely different sets of species.

Limousin
: Limousin is a variation on the same theme as the Ridges. It's a pair of impossibly long landmasses. One encircles the other. The landmasses of Limousin  much flatter than The Ridges, and can be fairly easily cross by explorers. Limousin is also notable for having an archipelago which looks oddly similar to the continent of Lewis, though not similar enough that coincidence can be entirely ruled out.

Redland
: The island of Redland is so named because the local ecosystem is dominated by plants with red cholorplasts instead of green. There are no major settlements on the island, as the soil isn't conducive to the growth of edible crops. But the island attracts the occasional botanist or tourist.

Greenland
: The island of Greenland is so named because the local ecosystem is dominated by plants which are green. 

Cawlswop
: In the Cawlswop Archipelago, the rivers are wonky. There are several rivers which run from sea to sea, a river which flows in a wide loop, a river that 'splits' as it flows downhill from a single source, and a network of rivers which seem to 'breathe', periodically reversing direction. The cause of this phenomenon is currently unknown. One researcher petitioned Invreizen for answers, saying "Rivers are just water falling downhill towards the sea. Why is it that these rivers don't seem to work that way?" Invreizen responded by hurling the researcher off a cliff. 

The Obcidussian Isles
: These isles rise and fall on a yearly cycle. The low-lands are lush with life, but incredibly smelly. The grinding of stone as the island slowly moves causes a constant deep rumble.

Isles of Cristatus
: Although the remote location of these dome-shaped isles makes accurate surveys difficult, there is strong evidence that the number and size of these isles is slowly, but measurably growing. One survey of the area from 323 BE reported only a few large islands. The veracity of this report is in question, but if true, it would suggest that the growth of the isles is a faster phenomenon than is otherwise believed. The Isles of Cristatus have sparse vegetation, but are densely populated by large aggressive sea birds. If a defensible settlement were to be permanently established, the guano could be an economically valuable export.

Gon
: Gon is a landmass comprised of titanic monolithic cuboids. They aren't iviolable, just composed of a variety of very durable minerals. Several areas in the seams between cuboids have accumulated enough soil to facilitate settlement, and Gon has a moderately sized export industry which quarries the exotic stone and exports slabs via bulk transportation. 

Lesser Silver Sea
: Nestled between the continents of Royoso and Lewis, the Lesser Silver Sea is home to a species of salt-water-adapted fern which blankets the entire sea, almost without gap. These ferns are pale in color, and are coated with a slick oil. In calm weather, they can form a smooth silvery layer on top of the water. Hence the sea's name. It is unknown what prevents the ferns from spreading into the wide ocean. Perhaps they are dependent on some kind of mineral runoff from the neighboring continents.


Mo

## Continents Visited in Canon

Bretaigne
: Heart of the Empire of Common Cause. Where the story begins and where much of it takes place.

Corrito
: Another continent extensively integrated into the empire. Large portions are marred by Fel Seed's Domain.

Lion's Mane
: Not a continent proper, but rather the isthmus joining Corrito to Senol. On a train voyage across the Lion's Mane, the Party met the Tuung Princess Emomain and Magor the Dwarf.

Senol
: A warm continent filled with lush vegetation. The majority of Senol drains into the might River Boul, which flows not into the sea, but into the Boundless Pit at Headwater.

Auberlo
: A gigantic continent, with landmass on par with the entirety of Earth. Diverse geography. Home to the Spine of the World, longest and tallest mountain range on Aerb; a vast grassland north of the Yellow sea; and the largest endorheic basin on the hex, which drains into the Saltin Sea. This continent has never been the center of the empire, but many parts of it are settled, some densely so. Anglecynn in particular has a number of established sites in the Northern half of Auberlo.

Widders
: A continent that gently slopes upwards from West to East. The Eastern edge of the continent features the great vertical city of Cidium, built into a cliff-face three miles high. Although the entire continent is 'tilted', the grade is barely noticable except near the Eastern edge. And by some definitions, Widders is mathematically flatter than a pancake. <!--Technically flatter than a pancake.--> 

Leche
: Location of the Datura Desert, and Boastre Vino. Rocky terrain and mountains in places that don't quite make sense.

Kerguelia
: Home of Li'o and the Atheneum of Sound and Silence. Li'o is far from the ocean, but a quirk of the projection layer renders it warm and humid.

Ankja
: Cradle of the Second Empire, and major hotspot for exclusions<!-- as a consequence (as a consequence of both population and policy)-->. The River Jesh is the largest river in the world and spans three continents (though it could really be said to span anywhere between 1 and 4 continents, depending on how the continents are defined). <!--The extensive Jeshi waterways bring prosperity to the region, though their benefits have somewhat diminished because Exclusions now block river access to the Ocean, and the so goods must be transferred between waterways must be transferred between ship and rail.-->

Fricase
: Home to Dorisopolis and the Crooked Citadel.

Pseudami
: Home to Perisev the Wretched.

Gyges
: Another Imperially integrated continent. Home to Darili Irid and the Atheneum of Barriers. If the landmass of Jarthram is considered part of Gyges, then this continent also is home to Claw and Clocks, as well as Invreizen's temple at Frustbury.

Artisinge
: Artisinge was created as a frigid continent, covered in ice. But some 8000 years ago, a shift in the projection layer rendered the continent temperate. It is now most notable for its extensive network of freshwater lakes, including Remar Lake, which is over 1000 miles deep and, by volume, the largest body of freshwater in all of Aerb. Oral tradition is that the inhabitants of Remar were quite upset when their home was exposed to bright skies. The Amber Lands can also be found here.
