### d12 Random Magical Materials with Impossible Properties
1. [Dirt](https://paperelemental.blogspot.com/2019/01/the-dirt-merchant.html)
2. Skywood: Dense, hard wood which resists the pull of gravity. Grows as trees which float through the air, carrying along clumps of earth tangled in their roots. Wicker panels of the stuff are used to craft flying ships.
3. Adamant Glass: Cloudy gray glass, impossible to sully or scratch. Impervious and impenetrable to all forms of chemical or magic, meaning it can be used to entrap ghosts, spells, and other spirits. Really easy to melt, though, and can shatter violently.
4. Vermillion Ichor: Like red-tinged quicksilver. Constantly jitters in place. Imbues anything it's placed into with elan vital, compelling it into motion and imbuing it with will.
5. Magnets
7. Shimmersilk: Lightweight fluttering cloth of indeterminate form. Appearance changes based on the viewers' expecations
8. Alkahest: Universal perfect solvent, seperates things into their constituent components without otherwise damaging or changing them.
9. Tomberstone: Stone which hates the heavens. Dark violet with streaks of iridescent yellow. Greenish-red with a greasy lustre. When directly under an open sky, it pushes downwards with immense force. When covered, behaves like normal stone.
10. Chornolyst: Magical kudzu. Thick sticky pitch-black sheets which grow rapidly over surfaces in the presence of mana and bright light. Rapidly dies and rots in their absence. Tough but flexible. Highly flammable. Technically edible. 
11. True Vitriol:  Green-Red crystal with a greasy lustre. Eternally burns with an unquenchable putrid flame. Powerful heat, but irritating headache-causing flickering light.
12. Ectoplasm: A versatile stringy substance that can be regurgitated by skilled experts. A sort of physical manifestation of the soul which responds to the emitter's will. Is capable of fine manipulation and interaction with a wide variety of magical phenomena. The main drawback is that any damage to the substance has drastic psychic health consequences for the person who squeezed it out.
6. Philosopher's stone: Turns mercury into silver on contact, lead into gold, reverses aging, frags trolls, etc.
13. Slarmbe: Insulates from time. Kind of a salty amber-tinted jelly. Kind of just a zone of shimmering air. Kind of makes you go cross-eyed to look at it. The thicker it covers an object, the more slowly that thing advances through time. Can be arduously moved by prodding it with a long stick.
14. Solidified Nimbus: Like the cartoon version of a cloud. Soft and moldable. Cold to the touch. Drips water out of the bottom when squeezed. Accumulates static electricity.
15. Null: Absorbs energy practically without bound. Unworkable and immovable in its pure form. Can be dissolved and alloyed to produce immovable rods and similar wonders.
16. Impressionable Flesh: Raw animal matter in its most magically pure state. Often mistaken for a species of pale grey ooze. Assimilates small bits of detritus and small clumps of organic matter. When it comes into contact with a larger body of living flesh, it merges into and assumes the form of that flesh. Potent for healing, and can even restore lost limbs. Contraindicated for head and spinal injuries, under penalty of execution.
17.  Demoncore: Densely malevolent metal, brimming with alchemical power. Capable of poisoning those who merely stand near it, or providing a near limitless source of arcane energy.
18.  [Voidmetal](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-mdGRNm2-f66yo-DYw): Sticks to shadows and vice versa
19.  [Pureglass](https://renaissancewoodsman.wordpress.com/2021/01/11/100-planes-part-one-the-elements/): Perfectly invisible stone.
20.  [Song-glass](http://weirdwonderfulworlds.blogspot.com/2020/07/element-generator.html): Frost that dissolves into radio static whispers divine secrets.

<!--

Make ichor sparky? Elmo's fire on top?
The chornolyst can be anti fire? and the soil can be wet dense and dark?
Glass can be hard subtle dry or hard subtle cold
dry still hot can be like tar or something?
Dry still hard can be slarmbe but modified into a salt
Give puregalss the ability to harden or dissolve? like utility fog
