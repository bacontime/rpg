title: Etymological Elemental Planes
description: Elemental planes, but adjusted to include things that are only linguistically related.

Worldbuilding activity: 

Take a pure element. Build an elemental plane out of that element. 
To mix things up, give the plane additional features via word association.

## Motivation

Other planes of reality are a fun concept to play around with.
But to work in a tabletop setting, PCs need to have a reason to venture into those planes.
Hence, any strange magical otherworlds should ideally be:

- Explorable: 
    - There should be a variety of environments which are interesting to interact with.
    - Native life-adjacent entities (elemental flora, fauna, and folk) to talk to and/or try to eat.
    - It must be possible to actually traverse the plane. A subteranean world needs an extensive network of caves for example.
- Exploitable:
    - Interesting materials or treasure abound
    - There's some reason that someone else is willing to pay a group of murderhobos to ransack the place.
- Just a little bit dangerous:
    - There should be some reason that only fools (eg the party) are willing to explore the place
    - But it shouldn't be *so* dangerous that even fools won't risk it. 
        A plane of elemental radiance that instantly burns out your eyes and gives you turbo cancer might be interesting, but nobody will ever go there.
    - I like to make it so there's *just one thing* that prevents people from permanently settling down.
    
So you could do an elemental plane of carbon but just having an infinite solid lump of carbon, but players won't want to go there.
And if they do go there, it won't be an interesting adventure.
