# A Metric System for Faerun

In many tabletop roleplaying games, 
the **round** of 6 seconds, 
and the **space** or **square** of 5 feet 
serve as basic units of measurement for game mechanics.
Just for fun, let's try to actually construct a 
system of measurement using these as our base units for time  and distance.

The self-imposed rules of the exercise are as follows:
- Derived units are expressed simply in terms of base units. ([Coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(units_of_measurement)))
- Larger or smaller units use a consistent exponential power (Though I'm not sticking to decimal).
- And if possible, the resulting system should feel psuedo-medieval, be intuitive to a 21st century American, and be useful for rules of thumb in a tabletop rpg.

## Units of Time.

One of the starting points is that our base unit of time is the **round**, which is equal to to 6 seconds.

Here's an interesting observation:
A 24-hour day is equal to 14400 = 120 times 120 rounds. 
This suggests the use of a base-120 system of units,
which is handy for that psuedo-medieval feel,
because ["hundred" used to refer to units of 120](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hundred#English_unit).

Whenever you see "_hundred_" in the rest of this post, you should interpret it as a "long hundred" or 120.
For example:

- The base unit of time is the **round** (6 seconds).
- There are a hundred rounds in a **turn** (12 minutes),
- a hundred turns in a **day**,
- a hundred days in a **season** (120 days),
- and roughly a hundred seasons in a **career** (40 years).

And the nice thing about 120 is that it has lots of devisors, so all the other units of time we're used to slot right in [^normaltimeunits]. 

[^normaltimeunits]: A minute is 10 rounds, an hour is 5 turns, a month is a quarter-season, etc.
And a year of 365 days is *a bit more than* 3 seasons, but eh.
This is a fantasy world, so if that bothers you, then you can totally just make the year a bit shorter.
Nobody will even notice.

Also, I don't see such a tiny unit being useful in ttrpg time counting, but we can also go down one level. 
1/120th of a round is 50 milliseconds.
Just for fun, let's call this a **tick**[^minecraftreference].

[^minecraftreference]: In same video games, the state of the world is updated at a rate seperate from the framerate. The length of time between each update of the game's physics engine is called a "gametick" or "tick". I used to play way too much Minecraft, and in Minecraft, the physics engine of the game updates 20 times a second (once every 50 milliseconds). This unit of time is important for understanding various in-game contraptions. For comparison [here is a 20hz metronome (Warning: loud and annoying sound.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk0LGDBRlCo). I can easily imagine a wizard's workshop full of the background noise of various whatzits softly hissing and clicking at that frequency.



## Units of distance

The size of a square on a tabletop rpg grid is 5 feet. 
Calling the unit of length a "square" would be rather confusing,
We could also call it the "space", but there's a slightly more interesting option:
Classically, [the Roman _pace_ was 5 Roman feet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_(unit)),
so let's call our base unit of length the "pace" (even though it's slightly longer than a Roman pace).
And then in-universe, "space" could be a pormanteau of "square pace", making the battle-grid diagetic.

- The base unit of distance is the **pace** (5 feet).
- There are a hundred paces in a **field** (600 feet),
- and a hundred fields in a hex (about 13.6 ft).

## Dozenal measurement systems

### John Volan Primel System

#### Primel Time

- 12 dwells in a day. (Each dwell is two hours.) 
- 12 breathers in a dwell. (Each breather is ten minutes.)
- 12 trices in a breather. (Each trice is 50 seconds.)
- 12 lulls in a trice. (Each lull is 4 and 1/6 seconds.)
- 12 twinklings in a lull. (Each twinkling is a bit more than a third of a second.)
- And the base unit is a vibe or *timel*, which is 1/12 of a twinkling.

#### Primel position, speed, acceleration, etc.

- The fundamental unit is the acceleration from gravity at earth's surface, called an *accerlerel* or *gravity*. I think *grav* would also be a cute name. It's abuot 9.8 m/s/s or 32 ft/s/s.
    - A specific location is given for measuring the gravity strength, which results in a slightly lower number than SI gravity. This position was chosen to make the conversions between Primel and SI exact.
- The unit of speed and velocity is the *velocitel* or *speedel* or *accerlerel timel* or *gravity vibe*, which happens to be approx 1.02 km/h or .93 ft/s  
- The unit of length is called a *lengthel* or *morsel length*, equal to a *gravity vibe^2*, and approximately 1/3 of an inch (archaically called a barleycorn)
    - Thus the unit of velocity can also be defined as *one morsel per vibe* 
    - In colloquial terms, 12 morsel lengths makes a hand length (slightly smaller than the customary 4 inch hand).
    - 12 hands makes an ell length (slightly larger than the old english 45 inch ell).
    - 144 ell lengths makes a stadial length, which is exactly 558 feet, and slightly smaller than the Greek stadion.
    - 12 stadial lengths makes a dromal length (about 1.27 miles, exactly 6696 feet).
    - 12 dromals makes an internal, which is about 15.2 miles, and the limit of a Roman march
    - 3 dozen morsel lengths is about one foot.
    - Powers of two can similarly be accomodated to approximating US volume units.
- The *Areanel* is simply a square morsel or *morsel area*. It's about a tenth of a square inch.
    - A dozen morsel areas is called a stamp area. A dozen of those is a hand area or square hand.
- The *Volumel* is simply a cubic morsel length or *morsel volume*. It's about a tenth of a teaspoon.
    -  A hand volume (cubic hand length) is almost exactly a quart, and about .95 Liters.
    -  A dozen hand volumes is a bucket volume (3 gallons)
    -  A dozen bucket volumes is a drum volum (36.27 gallons, in the range of what's called a "barrel").


#### Other Primel Units

- The *densitel* is the density of water at (4 degrees C)
- The unit of mass is called a *massel* or a *morsel mass*, and is the mass of a cubic morsel of water. It's about .55 grams.
    - Similarly a dozen dozen dozen massels is called a *hand mass*, and is a bit larger than a kilogram.
    - A *bucket mass* is about 25 pounds.
    - A *drum mass* is about 303 pounds.
    - An *ell mass* is about 3632 pounds.
- The *forcel* or *morsel force* is equal to a *gravity massel*, and is aprroximately 5.4 milliNewtons
    - A *hand force* us about 9.34 N  
- The *energel* or *morsel energy* is equal to a *forcel morsel*, and is approximately 44.3 microJoules, or 443 ergs.
    - Likewise for work and heat, except they are contextually called *workel* and *heatel*.
    - A *hand work* is about .92 Joules.
- A hand-pressure (one hand force per hand area) is about .96 kPA
