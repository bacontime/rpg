## Dozenal measurement systems

### John Volan Primel System

#### Primel Time

- 12 dwells in a day. (Each dwell is two hours.) 
- 12 breathers in a dwell. (Each breather is ten minutes.)
- 12 trices in a breather. (Each trice is 50 seconds.)
- 12 lulls in a trice. (Each lull is 4 and 1/6 seconds.)
- 12 twinklings in a lull. (Each twinkling is a bit more than a third of a second.)
- And the base unit is a vibe or *timel*, which is 1/12 of a twinkling.

#### Primel position, speed, acceleration, etc.

- The fundamental unit is the acceleration from gravity at earth's surface, called an *accerlerel* or *gravity*. I think *grav* would also be a cute name. It's abuot 9.8 m/s/s or 32 ft/s/s.
    - A specific location is given for measuring the gravity strength, which results in a slightly lower number than SI gravity. This position was chosen to make the conversions between Primel and SI exact.
- The unit of speed and velocity is the *velocitel* or *speedel* or *accerlerel timel* or *gravity vibe*, which happens to be approx 1.02 km/h or .93 ft/s  
- The unit of length is called a *lengthel* or *morsel length*, equal to a *gravity vibe^2*, and approximately 1/3 of an inch (archaically called a barleycorn)
    - Thus the unit of velocity can also be defined as *one morsel per vibe* 
    - In colloquial terms, 12 morsel lengths makes a hand length (slightly smaller than the customary 4 inch hand).
    - 12 hands makes an ell length (slightly larger than the old english 45 inch ell).
    - 144 ell lengths makes a stadial length, which is exactly 558 feet, and slightly smaller than the Greek stadion.
    - 12 stadial lengths makes a dromal length (about 1.27 miles, exactly 6696 feet).
    - 12 dromals makes an internal, which is about 15.2 miles, and the limit of a Roman march
    - 3 dozen morsel lengths is about one foot.
    - Powers of two can similarly be accomodated to approximating US volume units.
- The *Areanel* is simply a square morsel or *morsel area*. It's about a tenth of a square inch.
    - A dozen morsel areas is called a stamp area. A dozen of those is a hand area or square hand.
- The *Volumel* is simply a cubic morsel length or *morsel volume*. It's about a tenth of a teaspoon.
    -  A hand volume (cubic hand length) is almost exactly a quart, and about .95 Liters.
    -  A dozen hand volumes is a bucket volume (3 gallons)
    -  A dozen bucket volumes is a drum volum (36.27 gallons, in the range of what's called a "barrel").


#### Other Primel Units

- The *densitel* is the density of water at (4 degrees C)
- The unit of mass is called a *massel* or a *morsel mass*, and is the mass of a cubic morsel of water. It's about .55 grams.
    - Similarly a dozen dozen dozen massels is called a *hand mass*, and is a bit larger than a kilogram.
    - A *bucket mass* is about 25 pounds.
    - A *drum mass* is about 303 pounds.
    - An *ell mass* is about 3632 pounds.
- The *forcel* or *morsel force* is equal to a *gravity massel*, and is aprroximately 5.4 milliNewtons
    - A *hand force* us about 9.34 N  
- The *energel* or *morsel energy* is equal to a *forcel morsel*, and is approximately 44.3 microJoules, or 443 ergs.
    - Likewise for work and heat, except they are contextually called *workel* and *heatel*.
    - A *hand work* is about .92 Joules.
- A hand-pressure (one hand force per hand area) is about .96 kPA
