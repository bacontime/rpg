# Ur substances

## Skywood
<!--Dark, Subtle, Still-->
Appearance
: A dark hard wood. Like blue-tinged ebony. 

Properties
: Very dense, yet bouyant in the air. High inertia, low weight. Incredibly resiliant.

### Skywood thickets
Skywood grows on the highest mountaintops, precipitating from the air in towering tangled thickets of thorny, leafless "trees".
Because the wood is so tough and unfettered by the pull of gravity, 
the trees can grow to colossal heights, 
making a giant redwood look like a sapling by comparison.
Without leaves, it takes many thousands of years for the skywood to grow to such heights.

<!--The thickets are frequently struck by lightning, 
but skywood trees are able to harmlessly conduct lightning through their branches.
Best not to stand near one in a storm.-->

### Floating islands
Some thickets are dense and bouyant enough that they lift off into the air,
ripping off a massive clump of rock and soil to carry with them.
These floating islands are surprisingly stable. 
The root networks are dense in more ways than one, 
and the supernatural inertia of the skywood helps temper the rage of the wind.

These floating islands act as sanctuaries to birds and insects. 
More complex mini-ecosystems can develop if the island drifts close enough to the ground to pick up additional flora and fauna.
One such island was famously discovered to be populated with a large number of cats,
which were later determined to all be the descendents of a single breeding pair 
that hitched a ride on a hot-air-balloon visit to the island several decades prior.

### Attempts at silvaculture
Skywood can be propagated from live cuttings, 
and some attempts have been made to cultivate the substance.
The most effective methods consists of planting many thousands of tiny trees, 
and pollarding them as soon as they reach any notable size.
Such farms are said to look like bristly paintbrushes sticking up out of the ground, 
and require special systems of weights and anchors to prevent the entire field from lifting up into the air.
Even with this effort, it takes decades of growth to get usable amounts of wispy-thin skywood branches.

For practical applications, these skywood cuttings are typically woven into resiliant wicker panels.
Sometimes the wood is also shredded and used in composite materials, 
though this weakens its magical properties.

### Poaching
To get thicker solid pieces of skywood would require either 
cultivating it for many centuries or
harvesting it from an ancient wild specimen.
Many ancient skywood thickets have been sadly lost to poaching in recent years.
Those remaining are either so high and remote that it's perilous to even get to them, or 
are under the protection of some local authority.

Farming the wood for so long is a difficult proposition, 
as it is rare for a land to remain unconquered and untroubled by bandits for unbroken centuries.
And the short-term rewards of selling off a wealth of skywood sticks 
incentivize pillagers to just rip up the entire farm.

### Immovable Rods
Nevertheless, there is a cabal of monks who maintain an ancient skywood grove somewhere in the mountains to the north.
They take great care to obfuscate the true location of their monastery, 
and sell a very small quantity of fabulously valuable skywood logs once every decade.
They also harbor the secret of augmenting the wood's magic to create *Immovable Rods*.

Immovable Rods aren't actually immovable of course. When activated, the rod is temporarily stilled, 
and then by some unknown arcane process, the skywood's weightless inertia is amplified. 
It's not that an Immovable Rod hangs in the air, 
so much as it is that the meager weight of the rod itself (or a human hanging on to the rod, or an elephant, or...)
can only imperceptibly accelerate the device.

If an Immovable Rod is kept activated, 
and a steady pressure is applied over the course of weeks, 
it can reach visible speeds.
This renders the rod into a slow but devastating siege weapon.
Of the five Immovable Staves gifted to Emperor Billy the Magnanimous: 
- One is deep underground, having finally splintered after shattering the bedrock,
- two are lost to the heavens,
- one has come to a stop underwater, 20 miles out to sea,
- and the final stave is kept in the royal treasury in an iron box, bolted shut.

phone drafts below


## SkyWood
- Still, dark, subtle
- Rich mahogony
- All woody plants, stems, roots, thorns. But also chitin carapaces. This magically embodies the structural material component that allows plants to grow to large sizes. Bone too maybe?
- used to craft immovable rods
- Harvested from a species of thorny tree that predominantly  floats around through the upper atmospheres, clinging to clumps of loose earth. 
- incredibly strong and dense but less heavy than you might expect.
- It's not that it's lightweight. Rather it just has so much inertia that it doesn't tend to fall. 
- if a piece does fall from the sky, ~~it hits with the force of a meteor impact, which discourages people from trying to harvest them midair.~~
- If you obtain a live cutting, you can plant it and propogate it into a whole new tree. Weigh it down to keep it from lifting off into the sky and taking your orchard with it.
- there is an order of monks who maintains an orchard of these trees, and magically sterilizes any specimens before sale. Most famously used to produce the "Immovable Rod", a skywood staff coupled with a device which can be tuned to enhance or diminish its magical properties. 









## Folds of holding?

- subtle still dry
- ??? Anything sufficiently folded??? Stangnant air???
- some sort of extradimesnional storage space. Dry because seperation, subtle because weight is ignoring, still because preserves time within.
- 




## ?

- still hard dry





## Adamant Glass
- Hard dry bright
- Glass, igneous stone, lenses, eyes, sight
- Shimmering and semi reflective
- Reveals truth behind it. See in the dark, see through fog, illusions etc
- when fractured, explodes into a million sharp fragments and 
- continues to fragment until it disintigrates into fresh clean air.
- Practically indestrucrible and can contain anything, but everything piece has a fatal flaw.


## Gold?
- bright dense hard
- Treasure? Hoarding. Precious metals, relics, certain gems?
- Accumulates in place and grows in power. Corrupts. Something about kingly might.
- Makes things more real and gives them more force upon the world.
- Prevents decay. But still keeps dynamics, and prevents recipient from moving. 
- Very subtle effects like lotr style magic
- crystalized fame?




## ~~Quicksilver?~~ Firmament
- bright dense motion
- The stuff of the celestial spheres which whirl about to seperate the various planes of existence
-    
- shimmering and silky when girmly anchored to something or sitting on a surface. Like all the beauty of a nebula but 1000 times as bright because its right next to your face.
- some seers swear that it enhances their future sight.
- when allowed to fall, rapidly accelerates, slamming with great force into the ground. 
- the opposite of elemental earth and so is attracted to it like opposite charges
- prized for its beauty but incredibly difficult to transport
- even a slight jostle can send it blasting through the bottom of your backpack.
- Completely sealing inside some magical container can lessen the weight.




## Vermillion Ichor

- heft wet motion
- blood, nectar, honey, oil, maybe mercury
- Pale blue fluid, like metallic milk. Denser than lead. Constantly rippling.
- Imbues anything it's placed into with elan vital, compelling it into motion and imbuing it with will. 
- can be used to animate golems, raise corpses, and cause ropes to behave like snakes
- Incredibly toxic, simply because if it gets into your body, then your organs will rebel and your body will tear itself apart
- Some people swear that a dilute mixture will invigorate the body and heal any disease, but this is likely just hocum from people who've never seen real ichor.
- Or possibly people who try it go insane and think they're recieving some benefit.




## Primordial Flesh

- wet soft motion
- Pale purple greasy slugs, slowly wriggling and blind, adorned with psueedopods
- Can be freely split and combine, like a gristly ooze
- When placed in contact with flesh, 
     -  will dissolve and assimilate the flesh if it's smaller than the slug
     - Will integrate itself into the flesh if the flesh is larger
-   can be used to heal any flesh wound.
-  Do not use to treat head injuries
-  Supposedly delicious when fried, but a bit too salty for my tastes.
- Carefully farmed for medical purposes. Best fed live animals to keep it clean. Mostly bugs. Carefully keep it split to prvent it from growing too large. Drains lined with meat filters to keep pieces from escaping down the drains.



## Ur Soil

- Wet dark soft
- soil clay sand silt fungus, rot, etc. Also insects and vermiforms
- Rich loamy soil with a sweet but pungeant rummy odor. Like rum mixed with farts.
- Accelerates both growth and decay of anything placed in it. 
- fruits ripen more quickly, organisms age faster, etc
- Plants also grow bigger and heartier
- Don't sleep on it
- effects scale in proportion to the concentration of the stuff
- when mixed in with a compost pile, can convert some of the rot into ur soil
- Unstable. Loses its magic after a few years unless renewed with rot.




## Leaf

- dark soft subtle
- or maybe swarms of insects go here. Sure chitin and leaves why not.
- Asorbs the light. Flexible material 
- You know, this is a great opportunity to go full on solar punk
- grows in layers when exposed to the sun
- moldable and can also be easily made in cloths
- suvks the lofe out of any mocrobes that touch it. Sterilizing. Apply as bandage only after scar has formed
- easily pierced but can absorb magical attacks
- cant be flowly like carbon tubs because it has to heavily drape over stuff.
- Pure embodiment of plant life




Some hefty thing. Plummets towards bedrock unless it's shielded from the ground. Wrapped entirely in leather or stored above glass etc. Firmament with stars embeded in.

Some sort of turbo gunpowder

A void thing






## Spark

## Vitriol

## Silk

## Ectoplasm
- soft( or maybe bright); motion  heat
- Definitely go with the bright idlf this stuff has memories in it.
- like a rapidly flickering bluegreen flame that gives off heat but no light.  It looks bright, but doesn't illuminate its surroundings and casts no shadows.
- Anything sapient has some of this stuff it its head. Ghosts are made of it too. Occasionally 
- Tornados are intensely intelligent by the way.
- Can phase through most material. Contained by glass.
- will sometimes stay in the palm of your hand 
- sprites born of intense singilar thought.







## Iron

- dense hard cold
- all base metal which can rust
- Just very very hard
- cold to the touch even on a hot day.
- can be heated. But still easily handled when hot. Conducts well when  old. Not so much when hot.
- anathema to fae
- steel is already magical enough. Don't need much more.

## Boneshell

- hard still cold


## Octiron
- cold dark still


## Raincloud
- cold dark wet
- like the kinda of mini cartoon raincloud you see floating over people's heads
- rain mist snow fog
- precipitates rain, more so when charged with magic
- like an actual raincloud but compact and persistant
- spontaneously generates during storms, sticks around for several days
- can emit many times more water than you qould expect based on size
- builds up static electricity. Just enough to shock you. Not enough to cause visible sparks.
- can be compressed and made permanent. Functions like a damp spongey low voltage battery. 
- or can be kept in a jar. Not permanent but lasts a lot longer that way.
- gravitates towards warm sources of moisture, will sometimes get stuck and 'follow' people.









Need something with incredible heat capacity but also incredible heat conduction. Like super diamond?
