# Aerbian Continents

## Canonical Continents

Bretaigne
: Heart of the Empire of Common Cause. Where the story begins and where much of it takes place.

Corrito
: Another continent extensively integrated into the empire. Large portions are marred by Fel Seed's Domain.

Lion's Mane
: Not a continent proper, but rather the isthmus joining Corrito to Senol.

Senol
: A warm continent filled with lush vegetation. The majority of Senol drains into the might River Boul, which flows not into the sea, but into the Boundless Pit at Headwater.

Auberlo
: A gigantic continent, with landmass on par with the entirety of Earth. Home to the Spine of the World, longest and tallest mountain range on Aerb, as well as the large inland Saltin Sea. This continent has never been the center of the empire, but many parts of it are heavily settled.

Widders
: A continent that gently slopes upwards from West to East. The Eastern edge of the continent features the great vertical city of Cidium, built into a cliff-face three miles high. <!--Technically flatter than a pancake.-->
