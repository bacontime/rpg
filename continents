# Aerbian Landmasses

While the map I made is canon, many of the details below are just things I was thinking while making the map.
So I wouldn't even call this document "semi-canon". It's more like worldbuilding fanfic.

## Continents Visited in Canon

Bretaigne
: Heart of the Empire of Common Cause. Where the story begins and where much of it takes place.

Corrito
: Another continent extensively integrated into the empire. Large portions are marred by Fel Seed's Domain.

Lion's Mane
: Not a continent proper, but rather the isthmus joining Corrito to Senol. On a train voyage across the Lion's Mane, the Party met the Tuung Princess Emomain and Magor the Dwarf.

Senol
: A warm continent filled with lush vegetation. The majority of Senol drains into the might River Boul, which flows not into the sea, but into the Boundless Pit at Headwater.

Auberlo
: A gigantic continent, with landmass on par with the entirety of Earth. Diverse geography. Home to the Spine of the World, longest and tallest mountain range on Aerb; a vast grassland north of the Yellow sea; and the largest endorheic basin on the hex, which drains into the Saltin Sea. This continent has never been the center of the empire, but many parts of it are settled, some densely so. Anglecynn in particular has a number of established sites in the Northern half of Auberlo.

Widders
: A continent that gently slopes upwards from West to East. The Eastern edge of the continent features the great vertical city of Cidium, built into a cliff-face three miles high. Although the entire continent is 'tilted', the grade is barely noticable except near the Eastern edge. And by some definitions, Widders is mathematically flatter than a pancake. <!--Technically flatter than a pancake.--> 

Ankja
: Cradle of the Second Empire, and major hotspot for exclusions<!-- as a consequence (as a consequence of both population and policy)-->. The continent The River Jesh is the largest in the world and spans three continents (though it could really be said to span anywhere between 1 and 4 continents, depending on how the continents are defined). <!--The extensive Jeshi waterways bring prosperity to the region, though their benefits have somewhat diminished because Exclusions now block river access to the Ocean, and the so goods must be transferred between waterways must be transferred between ship and rail.-->

Fricase
: Home to Dorisopolis and the Crooked Citadel.

Pseudami
: Home to Perisev the Wretched.



## Impossible Geography

Aerb has a lot of examples of 'What if X' in its design. 
Strange locations that reprent a concept stretched to its limits.

FIAF
: The continent of FIAF was created as a self-similar fractal. Mountains at one end are duplicated as hills than mounds, then motes of dust. This isn't a space-warping effect, and the fractal nature of the content isn't magically sustained, so the smallest iterations of the continent's features have been eroded into unrecognizability.

Leto
: A ring of mountains surrounds a arid, flat, isolated plateau roughly the size of Iowa. Exotic xerophile fauna live in this 'dry island' (microantelopes are abundant). 

Apes
: Like its sister continent Leto, Apes has a ring of mountains which isolate the interior. But whereas Leto's interior is cool and arid, Apes' interior is hot and humid. (It's also much much larger.) Water in the Apes basin quickly evaporates, but is trapped by the high mountains, giving this region a nearly self-contained water cycle. In the summertime, the interior region of Apes is inhospitable to human life.

Crososo
: The crescent-shaped continent of Crososo surrounds the super shallow Croso Sea. At low tide, this sea may only be ankle deep in places. It's one of the most biodiverse locations on the hex. 

Mo
: You are not legally authorized to learn about Mo.
