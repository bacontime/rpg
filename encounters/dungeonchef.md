## Description

20ft x 40 ft dungeon room

Worn-down chamber with ***cracked and leaky walls***.
A ***small cooking fire*** at the far end of the room, filling the the air with ***acrid smoke***. 
Two figures near the fire: one ***hunched over and stirring***; the other ***bound in rope***.

When you enter, the first figure acknowledges your presence. "Ah, it looks like we have visitors", she cackles. Then returns to stirring her bubbling brew. 

Cracked and leaky walls
: A trickle of water is coming into the room through cracked, mossy stone walls. The hag is collecting the water in small jars and shells. The water is maybe technically potable, but looks strangely green and smells like an umber hulk. Small dungeon flowers are growing in some of these cracks. These flowers will induce vomitting if eaten raw.

Small cooking fire
: Campfire sized.  Fuel is a combination of wood and greasy rags. Only source of light in the room, casting flickering eerie shadows on the walls. A pot of mysterious bubbling liquid sits atop the fire (it's the hag's lunch). 

Acrid smoke
: The smoke from the fire smells like bitter burning vegetables. There are passages to other rooms and some cracks in the ceiling which let small amounts of smoke out, but it's not enough to be considered proper ventilation, so smoke is starting to build up. 

The Cooking Hag, hunched over and stirring
: Wicked looking claws. Green warty skin. Dirty hands covered in blood and grime. Wiry hair so white it almost glows. Very hungry. Doesn't care about others. Her name is Hungrillda.

Goblin Captive, bound in rope
: Only has one very long hair on her head. Clothing made of stitched together rat pelts. Squeaky voice. Incredibly terrified, just wants to escape. Her name is Crunchwrap Supreme (it's a very common goblin name).

If the pot of liquid is dumped into the fire
: The fire is extinguished, smoke and steam fill the room. Treat the smoke like a [stinking cloud](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Stinking%20Cloud#content) (*Lasts up to 1 minute, dispersed by wind. Obscures the area. Each creature within the cloud at the start of the turn must CON save or spend its action that turn retching.*). The hag eats this nasty stuff on the reg, so she is immune to the retching effect.
